Movement Recognition System
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A wearable device that will identify the abnormal/unhealthy movement of the subject
(patient/elderly being) wearing the device. For the remaining short time of this
semester, we have constrained ourselves to build a prototype of this project that can do
binary prediction(Fast Walking & Relax).

It was a project for the lab of Embedded System Development of our 7th semester.
